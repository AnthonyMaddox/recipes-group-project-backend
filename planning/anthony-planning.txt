Anthony, Naira, Hema group project
Description: We are making a recipes application that allows the user to make an account and submit their own recipes. The user will have full CRUD capability to update delete create and search through recipes.
Models

const Recipe = new Schema({
  title: String,
  description: String,
  ingredients: [],
  instructions: String,
  picture: String,
});

const User = new Schema({
  username: String,
  password: String,
  email: String,
  recipes: [],
});
